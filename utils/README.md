This folder is to store and to maintain field utility scripts.
Most of the scripts are BASH scripts, but we are starting to write and support
PowerShell (extension .ps1) scripts.

## Naming Convention

- zn_* scripts are customer ready, meaning they are suitable for sharing with
  customers.

- All other scripts are best for internal use.
